    "Predicting student dropout in higher education has become a prevalent topic in educational research because early identification of at-risk students can enable universities and colleges to proactively support their students and try to prevent them leaving the college. Student attrition is a large loss to higher education institutions, as it represents lost tuition revenue, reduced completion metrics that reflect poorly on the institution itself, and an inefficient allocation of resources. Arguably, it is sometimes worse off for students, who may incur financial debt, delayed career entry, and negative psychological consequences from leaving college early. At a higher societal level, dropout undermine the workforce and its development, and only further education and economic inequality. \n",
    "\n",
    "This understanding has motivated more and more work to help model student dropout risk using early academic data, serving as a basis for data driven intervention strategies to help mitigate these fallbacks of dropout. Previous research suggests that much of dropout experienced in the first years of college, and is related to students' academic performance early on in their education as it could affect their belief in their academic fit and future success. This is believed to be because early academic success and/or failures act as a feedback loop to update student beliefs in their own abilities. Furthermore, when students fail to meet expectations early on, their assessment of whether or not higher education is a worthwhile financial investment is also called into question, leading to a higher chance of dropout.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on this theoretical research, researchers in educational data mining have this task of dropout prediction as a supervised machine learning problem. Studies applying traditional ML classification models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and boosting methods have found that academic performance serves as a relatively consistent predictor of dropout (as a binary classification task), amplified when the scope is purely on the first year of dropout. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). This study highlights the feasibility of utilizing a more traditional ML approach to accurately map out dropout rates, and motivates us to focus on early academic indicators. \n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding on this, a similar paper from UCI expands this to a multi-class classification task, adding three labels: graduated, dropped out, or still continuing the degree after the expected amount of time. They found similar results, arguing that early academic performance is a consistent predictor of student outcomes, but they also note that many other factors and variable do play a role, for example one being their financial situation and socioeconomic status. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). This study provides both a validated and cleaned dataset as well as a methodological reference point for modeling dropout. \n",

    "After looking at the data available to us, we predict that there will be a slight correlation between the early academic performance of a student and the likelihood of dropping out of university. Poor early academic performance doesn't necessarily mean that a student will inevitably fail; there are likely other factors that have a greater correlation with early dropout than poor early academic performance. Students can always catch up, but those who struggle early on will have a harder start to their college career that is more likely to lead to dropping out. "

    "1. Our ideal dataset would include first-year GPA, course completion rate, credit accumulation, and dropout status within one year, documented as a binary variable (0 = student dropped out, 1 = student remained enrolled) to allow for efficient data processing. Depending on the direction of the project, we may also want to incorporate additional variables such as demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), socioeconomic factors (family income bracket, first-generation status), high school GPA, field of study, institution type, and campus size. These additional variables would provide more context for each observation and allow us to draw more nuanced conclusions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    In terms of sample size, we would aim to include several thousand students, ideally over 5,000, to ensure sufficient statistical power and representation of dropout cases. The data would come from undergraduate students entering college for the first time and would be collected using academic records and enrollment statuses during students’ first year of college. These data could be obtained through institutional records, such as registrar data for GPA, credits earned, and course completion, and enrollment databases for registration and withdrawal statuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The data should be stored in a clean, tidy, and structured dataset where each row represents a single student and each column represents one variable. Time-based academic variables, such as term GPAs, should be stored in separate columns (e.g., “Fall GPA” and “Spring GPA”). To protect student privacy, each record should also include a unique anonymized student ID rather than personally identifiable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One potential dataset for this project is the Predict Students’ Dropout and Academic Success dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students%27+dropout+and+academic+success). This dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded directly without requesting permission, as it is released under a Creative Commons license. It contains data on approximately 4,400 undergraduate students, including demographic, socioeconomic, and academic performance information collected at enrollment and during the first year. Important variables for this project include semester grades, number of curricular units approved, number of units enrolled, and a categorical outcome variable indicating whether a student dropped out, remained enrolled, or graduated. This outcome variable can be converted into a binary indicator of dropout within one year.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Another useful dataset is the University Student Dropout Longitudinal Dataset hosted on Zenodo and described in an academic data paper (https://zenodo.org/records/17239943). The data are publicly accessible and can be downloaded as CSV files without special permission, though proper citation is required. This dataset tracks students across multiple academic terms and includes detailed information on course enrollments, grades, and credits earned. Key variables relevant to this project include course completion records, cumulative credits earned by term, and enrollment status across semesters, which can be used to derive first-year GPA, completion rates, and dropout within one year. The dataset also includes variables such as parental education level, placement exam results, age, number of assignments submitted, and number of exams taken, which may provide additional context in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A third potential dataset is the Tecnológico de Monterrey Student Dropout Dataset, available through a public DOI repository (https://datahub.tec.mx/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.57687/FK2/PWJRSJ). This dataset can be accessed freely and does not require institutional approval. It includes a large number of student records across multiple cohorts and contains academic performance indicators as well as information on the semester in which a student dropped out. Important variables for this study include grades, number of failed courses, and enrollment status by semester. The dataset also provides demographic information such as age, gender, and place of origin, along with variables related to institution type, financial aid eligibility, and extracurricular involvement."
